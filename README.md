# Sosial-media-Mkt project(Russian Interference in the US Election via Twitter)

My project for Social Media Marketing Course. The goal is to study the relationship between Russian automated tweets and the 2016 U.S. President Election.
Sentiment and Hashtag analysis are done on those tweets' JASON data.
